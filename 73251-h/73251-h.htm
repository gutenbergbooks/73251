<p class="salute"><span class="sc">Dear Sir</span>,
</p>
<p>To whom can I more fitly dedicate the following pages than to one, to whom, under
Divine Providence, I owe the inestimable blessings of renewed health and of an invigorated
constitution? Having derived untold benefit from the use of the Turkish Bath, first
introduced by you into this country, and having witnessed the wonders effected by
it in the case of others, I have felt it my duty to propagate the knowledge of its
virtues in every direction: this I have endeavoured to do in the following pages,
in conjunction with some observations on the Hydropathic and Allopathic systems.
</p>
<p>Should the perusal of these pages lead to the currency of more correct ideas on the
subject of Hygiene, and a greater knowledge of the principles of Hydropathy, than,
at present prevail, my object in writing will have been fully attained.
</p>
<p>Wishing you a long continuance in your career of enlightened usefulness,
</p>

<p class="first">Perhaps there is nothing more characteristic of the march of intellect of the present
day, or more indicative of a healthy tone of mind, than the suspicion with which the
public in general, and many physicians in particular, are beginning to regard the
use of drugs as curative agents—that chiefest engine of the allopathic physician for
the relief of suffering humanity.
</p>
<p>The freeing of the mind from old and preconceived ideas—from practices, with which
we have been familiarized from childhood—the looking with distrust upon a system which
since the times of Æsculapius and Hippocrates has held undisputed sway, arrogating
to itself the name of Orthodox, and dubbing its opponents as quacks—such a change
in public opinion deserves respect or reprobation, according to the causes from which
it springs, whether from a calm investigation of the question presented for examination,
in which strong arguments, based on natural laws—prescribing a treatment which produces
the results aimed at—are found to preponderate in favour of a new system, or from
a revolutionary love of novelty, indicative of versatility and want of faith in established
institutions, a love of change which would espouse and propagate any doctrine irrespective
of its merits, merely because it was new.
</p>
<p>That this change of opinion to which we refer, viz., the want of confidence in drugs,
is not altogether frivolous, would <span class="pageNum" id="pb6">[<a href="#pb6">6</a>]</span>appear from the following confession of Dr. Forbes, a distinguished allopathic physician,
who thus sums up the experience of a long professional career:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“Firstly, that in a large proportion of the cases treated by allopathic physicians,
the disease is cured by nature and not by them. Secondly, that in a lesser, but still
not a small proportion, the disease is cured by nature in <i>spite</i> of them; in other words their interference opposing instead of assisting the cure;
and Thirdly, that consequently in a considerable proportion of diseases it would fare
as well or <i>better</i> with patients, if all remedies, especially drugs, were abandoned.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>Again one of the most eminent of living medical writers says:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“When healthy properties are impaired, we know of no agent by which they can be <i>directly</i> restored, when vital action is perverted or deranged, we possess no means of <i>immediately</i> rectifying it, but we must be satisfied with using those means under which it is
most likely to <span class="asc">RECTIFY ITSELF</span>.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>It is the knowledge of these facts that has produced discontent with the usual mode
of medicinal treatment, and has encouraged the belief, that it does more harm than
good in cases of disease. Dr. Gully states:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“By it (the drug system) the body is placed in the most unnatural position, and its
efforts at relief constantly <i>thwarted</i>. Disease, which is quite as natural a process as health, is not allowed to go on
as nature would; the internal organs whose morbid action alone can cause death, are
made the arena for all sorts of conflicting and inflicting medical stimulants; and
between the action which these excite, and that which originally existed, their vitality
fails, their efforts towards restoration flag, and their functions are at last extinguished.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>Dr. Rush says:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“We have multiplied diseases—we have done more, we have increased their mortality.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>The celebrated Dr. Bailie, who enjoyed, it appears, a long and lucrative practice,
declared at the termination of his career, “that he had no faith in physic;” and on
his death-bed frequently exclaimed, “I wish I could be sure that I have not killed
more than I have cured.”
</p>
<p>Abernethy observes sarcastically,
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“There has been a great increase of medical men of late years, but upon my life, diseases
have increased in proportion.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>The British and Foreign Quarterly Journal—the leading advocate of drug medication—thus
writes:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“This mode of treating disease (Hydropathy) is unquestionably far from inert, and
most opposed to the cure of diseases, by the undisturbed processes of nature. <i>It in fact perhaps affords the very best evidence we possess of the curative power
of art, and is unquestionably when rationally <span class="pageNum" id="pb7">[<a href="#pb7">7</a>]</span>regulated a most effective mode of treatment in many diseases.</i> Still it puts in a striking light, if not exactly the curative powers of nature,
at least the possibility—nay, facility—with which all the ordinary instruments of
medical cure, drugs, may be dispensed with. If so many and such various diseases get
well entirely without drugs, under one special mode of treatment, is it not more than
probable, that a treatment consisting almost exclusively of drugs may be often of
non-effect—sometimes of injurious effect?”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>Dr. Headland, in his prize essay on the action of medicines on the system, thus writes:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“On no question perhaps have scientific men differed more than on the theory of the
action of medicines. Either facts, essentially opposed and incompatible, have been
adduced by the disagreeing parties, or which is nearly as common, the same fact has
received two distinct and opposite interpretations.<span class="corr" id="xd32e303" title="Not in source">”</span></p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>Such quotations as the above, which might be multiplied <i lang="la">ad infinitum</i>, by any student of medical lore, show that enquiry is abroad amongst the medical
profession, and that some at least of its members are dissatisfied with the truth
of the system which would consider drug medication as an essential instrument in the
cure of disease.
</p>
<p>The following remarks by Dr. Maclæoud, contained in a letter written by him to Professor
Simpson of Edinburgh, show at least, that if the lay public place confidence in allopathic
drugging, they place their faith in a system which does not command the confidence
of physicians themselves.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“Formerly there were several wards in the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, of which three
Fellows of the Royal College of Physicians had the charge. One physician had the top
ward, another the middle ward, and a third the low ward. It happened that on the same
day, three young persons of nearly the same age, ill of typhus fever, were admitted
into the hospital. The disease was of equal severity in each, and the stage of complaint
the same in all. What was the treatment pursued in those three cases, by the three
Fellows of the College? Of course, it should have been the <i>same</i>, at least, if the system be correct; for the physicians in question would choose
the best. But, sir, it was not the same. He in the top ward bled his patient with
lancet and leeches. He in the middle ward treated his patient with drastic purgatives.
He in the low ward, again, gave whiskey, wine, and opiates. What was the result of
such deplorable freaks? I refer you to the statistic book; I have no doubt you will
find it there!”
</p>
<p>“In the University formerly, two professors used to lecture, on alternate days, on
clinical medicine<span class="corr" id="xd32e319" title="Not in source">.</span> It happened once that each had, at the same time, under his care an acute case of
<i>pericarditis</i>. The professor who lectured on his case on Monday night, said in substance, as follows:—
</p>
<p>“<span class="sc">Gentlemen.</span>—As to the treatment of this disease, it has been the practice <i>to give large doses of mercury</i>, so as to bring the constitution under its action, and to effect this as rapidly
as possible, small quantities of opium are usually combined with it. The <i>practice I</i>, however, <i>believe <span class="pageNum" id="pb8">[<a href="#pb8">8</a>]</span>to be erroneous</i>; for I have observed the progress of the <i>disease unchecked</i>, even during <i>profuse salivation</i>. The most efficient remedy—in fact our <i>sheet-anchor</i>—in this disease is <i>tartar</i> emetic. You will have noticed the large doses I have given of this remedy, and yet
the patient seems not to suffer from it. In fact, the constitution in this disease,
as in some others, has a remarkable tolerance for tartar emetic.”
</p>
<p>“When the lecture was finished, I left the hall fancying I had heard some great truth,
and knew <i>better</i> than an hour before how to save life. On Wednesday evening, during the same week,
in the same hall, and to the same students, the other professor lectured. The lecture
was devoted to the acute case of <i>pericarditis</i> under <i>his</i> care in the hospital. After describing the case, and giving a sketch of the character
and progress of the disease, he spoke in substance, as follows:—
</p>
<p>“<span class="sc">Gentlemen.</span>—It is a remarkable thing that there should be any difference in regard to the mode
of treatment to be pursued in a disease such as this, I believe it is the Italian
and French schools which advocate so very strongly the employment of tartar emetic;
but I would strongly urge you <i>to put no confidence</i> in this remedy, for if you do so, you will lean on <i>a broken reed</i>. Our <i>sheet-anchor</i> in this disease is <i>mercury</i>; under the action of which you must bring the patient as soon and as freely as you
possibly can—even bleeding is of little importance in comparison with the use of mercury.
The two combined, <i>i.e.</i>, mercury and blood-letting is, of course, best; but at all events use <i>mercury</i>, and <i>never trust to tartar emetic</i>.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Thus doctors differ and the patient dies.” </p>
</div>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>As in the theatrical world a peep behind the scenes destroys the illusion of the piece,
so in the real world such revelations as the foregoing, are well calculated to stagger
thoughtful minds, and to shake to the centre a blind and unreasoning faith in the
allopathic system.
</p>
<p>Does not the reflection suggest itself on reading such a revelation as the above—since
it is impossible that the practice of both these learned professors can be right,
is it not possible that the practice of <i>both</i> may be wrong?
</p>
<p>That eminent physician, the late Sir Philip Crampton, was in the habit of warning
all his gouty and rheumatic patients to avoid the use of colchicum, terming it a “desperate
remedy,” and affirming that it was better to bear any amount of pain than have recourse
to it. This was the deliberate opinion of one of the most able men in his profession,
who must have been fully impressed with a conviction of its injurious effects; yet
this remedy is continued to be prescribed to thousands, with what result let those
who have experienced it testify. Here then again is a <i>serious</i> disagreement in practice between members of the medical profession, in which one
party must again be wrong. If those who use colchicum are to be ranged amongst the
latter, where <i>our own sufferings</i> <span class="pageNum" id="pb9">[<a href="#pb9">9</a>]</span>under it would place them, their victims may well be pitied. If colchicum be not a
poisonous drug, why did Sir Philip Crampton so strongly inveigh against it? If it
be, can that system be right which prescribes it as a remedy? Such is the system termed
orthodox, styling all who presume to differ from it quacks.
</p>
<p>Before we proceed to inquire whether any escape is open to us from this unsatisfactory
state of affairs—whether any system has been discovered more intelligible in its principles
and more certain in its action, whose professors are found to agree in their practice,
instead of maintaining opinions directly opposed to each other—we would respectfully
address a few words to those whom we have often heard exclaiming, “I cannot believe
that a system which has existed so long as the allopathic can be wrong; if it were,
it would long since have been exposed and its errors refuted. No; when I reflect how
long it has existed, I cannot but believe it is right.” To such we will merely say
that we charitably hope they do not call this exclamation an argument, and that if
they reflected for a moment they ought to remember numberless instances where error
has existed for centuries unrefuted, and acquiesced in by all mankind; that on their
principle error ought to prevail in exact proportion to its greatness, since the oldest
errors are the earliest, and the earliest are, generally speaking, the greatest, the
infancy of every science being its most imperfect stage. According to them, we should
at present believe that the sun moves round the earth, because this doctrine prevailed
for upwards of 5,000 years, and “if it had been wrong it could not have existed so
long.” If such persons studied human nature better, they would acknowledge the truth
of Horace’s lines, especially when applied to the medical profession, who, with some
honourable exceptions, have on every occasion opposed all innovation on their system
with the most uncompromising hostility—
</p>
<div lang="la" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Vel quia nil rectum, nisi quod placuit sibi, ducunt, </p>
<p class="line">Vel quia turpe putant parere minoribus et. quæ </p>
<p class="line">Imberbes didicere, senes perdenda fateri;”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e396src" href="#xd32e396">2</a> </p>
</div>
<p class="first">an hostility which can only be ascribed to the effects of professional habit and prejudice.
In such a profession reform must be brought about by the action of an enlightened
public opinion, which, unwarped by prejudice and unfettered by <span class="pageNum" id="pb10">[<a href="#pb10">10</a>]</span>professional trammels, is free to perceive truth, and hold to it when discovered.
When the public take the lead, the medical profession will “move on,” but not before.
We are sorry to be forced to make these observations, but we appeal to the history
of the medical profession past and present, and to the observation of our readers,
in confirmation of their truth.
</p>
<p>Sir Bulwer Lytton has well observed:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“A little reflection taught me that the members of a learned profession are naturally
the very persons least disposed to favour innovation upon the practices which custom
and prescription have rendered sacred in their eyes. A lawyer is not the person to
consult upon bold reforms in jurisprudence. A physician can scarcely be expected to
own that hydropathy will cure diseases that have resisted an armament of vials.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>On looking about us for some therapeutic system more satisfactory than the allopathic,
simpler in its principles and more consonant with the laws of nature, we select for
examination hydropathy, on account of the great success which has attended its practice,
the simplicity and rationality of its processes, and the high recommendations it has
received from several eminent men, amongst which we extract the following. Mr. Herbert
Mayo, Senior Surgeon of the Middlesex Hospital, speaking of hydropathy, thus expresses
himself:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“It (hydropathy) more than doubles our power of doing good. Of course it will meet
with much opposition, but none, <i>come from quarter it may, can possibly prevent its progress, and its taking firm root</i>. It is like Truth, not to be subverted.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>Sir Charles Scudamore, <span class="asc">M.D.</span>, records his opinion as follows:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“The principles of the water-cure treatment are founded in nature and truth. We have
in our power a new and most efficacious agent for the alleviation and cure of disease
in various forms, and in proper hands as safe as it is effectual. I should be no friend
to humanity nor to medical science if I did not give my testimony in its recommendation.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>Dr. James Johnson, Editor of the <i>Medical Quarterly</i>, thus writes of hydropathy:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“Its paramount virtue is that of preserving many a constitution from pulmonary consumption.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>These are no small recommendations for any system to possess. Let us, therefore, with
the <span class="corr" id="xd32e434" title="Source: readers">readers’</span> permission, proceed at once to examine the principles and mode of action of this
novel system, and see how far it can prove the title it lays claim to, of being a
<i>true rational and natural mode of curing disease</i>.
</p>
<p>The most eminent physiologists of the present day agree in regarding disease in general,
as an effort of nature to relieve <span class="pageNum" id="pb11">[<a href="#pb11">11</a>]</span>the system of matter injurious to its well-being. This being the case, the natural
and common sense mode of <i>curing</i> disease, would obviously consist in assisting nature in its efforts to expel the
morbid substance from the system, and thus relieve it from the danger which threatened
it. Now, this is exactly the principle on which Hydropathy proceeds; it aids, encourages,
and strengthens the efforts of nature to heal herself, instead of irritating, thwarting,
and weakening those efforts, by the pernicious administration of drugs.
</p>
<p>To render the foregoing position intelligible to our readers, it is necessary to premise,
that the action of all active medicines depends upon the principle (admitted by all
physiologists), that nature ever makes a continued effort to cure herself, never ceasing
in her attempts to relieve the body from whatever injurious matter may be present
in it. It is this effort of nature to expel the irritant matter from the system, which
makes the drug produce its effect. Thus when a preparation of sulphur is administered
as a medicine, nature, in her effort to get rid of the sulphur, opens her pores to
expel it. This is proved by the resulting perspiration, and by the circumstance that
everything in contact with the patient is found, on analysis, to be largely impregnated
with the constituents of the medicine;—the well-known fact of all articles of silver
about the person, being tarnished, being an illustration of this effect;—in addition
to this the stomach is weakened and irritated by the medicine which has been poured
into it; and further, if the dose is repeated, nature, getting gradually accustomed
to the intruder, ceases from her inhospitable exertion to expel it, and, as a consequence,
the medicine fails in producing its intended effect. We have here referred to the
<i>successful</i> administration of a drug, but in many instances it entirely fails to produce the
desired result, acting injuriously upon other organs of the system, quite contrary
to the effect intended. We will now compare this treatment with the hydropathic mode
of producing the effects aimed at by sudorifics. Instead of injuring the stomach by
pouring deleterious drugs into it, the Hydropathist applies himself; at once, to the
great organ he seeks to act on, viz., the skin; his usual appliances consisting of
the lamp and Turkish baths, and the result is this, that by his method a most powerful
effect is produced on the skin in the course of about half an hour, after which the
patient feels lightened, <span class="corr" id="xd32e449" title="Source: strengthed">strengthened</span>, and invigorated, no deleterious substances are passed into the stomach to irritate
its membranes, producing nausea and <span class="pageNum" id="pb12">[<a href="#pb12">12</a>]</span>other disagreeable results, and the process may be <i>repeated</i> as often as may be necessary with undiminished effect. Who ever saw a patient recovering
from the perspiratory process under the orthodox allopathic mode of treatment, that
was not weakened and dejected by it, whilst buoyancy of spirits and invigoration of
the system, are the usual accompaniments of the hydropathic process. Take another
example from the process of wet-sheet packing, and examine its effects in subduing
inflammatory and febrile affections. By this simple process the pulse is often reduced
from 120 pulsations per minute to sixty-five, in the short period of three-quarters
of an hour, the circulation equalized throughout the body, and a soothing effect produced
on the patient, which language fails to describe—a result which no drug or combination
of drugs, in the whole of the pharmacopeia, is capable of producing—in this case,
again, little lowering of strength is produced, and the stomach is again saved from
the injurious and irritating effects of Tartar emetic and other drugs; instead of
the fever raging for a period of three <i>weeks</i>, it is generally subdued in as many <i>days</i>, when the patient goes forth, but little reduced in strength, instead of weak, miserable,
and emaciated with the prospect of some six weeks elapsing before he is restored to
his wonted strength. Sir Bulwer Lytton thus describes, from personal experience, the
process of wet-sheet packing:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“The sheet, after being well saturated, is well wrung out—the patient quickly wrapped
in it—several blankets bandaged round, a down coverlet tucked over all; thus, especially
where there is the least fever, the first momentary chill is promptly succeeded by
a gradual and vivifying warmth perfectly free from the irritation of dry heat—a delicious
sense of ease is usually followed by a sleep more agreeable than anodyne ever produced.
It seems a positive cruelty to be taken out of this magic girdle in which pain is
lulled and fever cooled, and watchfulness lapped in slumber.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>In the effects of wet-sheet packing in cases of congestion of the liver and other
internal viscera, we fear an unfavourable comparison must again be drawn between the
effects of the allopathic and hydropathic modes of treatment. In these cases the object
to be effected is to relieve the oppressed and congested organs from the superabundance
of blood with which they are gorged; and it appears to us that this effect is produced
more certainly, more quickly, and more permanently, without subsequent injurious effects,
by the wet-sheet packing and other hydropathic appliances, sitz baths amongst the
rest, than could possibly be effected by all the drugs in the Apothecary’s Hall. In
fact, hydropathy appears to possess <span class="pageNum" id="pb13">[<a href="#pb13">13</a>]</span>greater power in <i>controlling the circulation and regulating the currents of the blood</i> than any other system of therapeutics yet revealed to us; it can stimulate the circulation
when low, reduce it when excited and disordered, determine it from the head in cases
of apoplexy and cold feet, and drive it to the surface of the body in cases of visceral
congestion. An engine capable of producing these effects <i>without weakening</i> the constitution, and possessing, in addition, the power of bracing and stimulating
the nervous system when weakened, and of soothing and allaying irritation wherever
it may exist, more effectually than any opiate; such a system we say, must ever occupy
a high, if not the foremost place amongst all existing systems of Hygiene. The physiological
effects of wet-sheet packing are thus described by Dr. Wilson:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“It fulfils many indications according to the various phases of disease; if you revert
to what I have said of the specific actions and effects of the packing process, you
will see sufficient ground for our using the invaluable aid of the wet sheet in chronic
disease. We often want heat to be abstracted in these diseases, we want the nerves
soothed, the circulation equalized, muscles rested, fatigue removed, a movement of
the fluids to be determined to the surface, interior congestions to be disgorged,
the equilibrium of the fluids established, secretions and exhalations to be promoted,
ill-conditioned solids to be broken up and eliminated, the tissues of the skin to
be soaked, its capillaries to be emptied and cleansed, its sentient extremities to
be soothed, and through them the brain to be quieted on the one hand, and the ganglionic<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e475src" href="#xd32e475">3</a> system to be roused on the other.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>How many lives have been sacrificed by the practice of bleeding in feverish and inflammatory
cases, from the non-adoption of wet-sheet packing, which causes no loss of strength,
and leaves behind none of the debility and consequent long convalesence, which bleeding
and strong medicines necessarily occasion. It is to us, indeed, inexplicable how so
insane a process as bleeding can still be resorted to in this enlightened 19th century,
a process which deprives nature of her <i>vital</i> fluid, and lets flow the stream on which our <i>very existence</i> depends.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e487src" href="#xd32e487">4</a> How can this tapping of the springs of life <span class="pageNum" id="pb14">[<a href="#pb14">14</a>]</span>be defended when an expedient for lowering inflammation without reducing the strength,
presents itself for adoption by the physician, one which by its action purifies the
blood, reducing fever by the abstraction of heat, and by the removal of the serum
or watery constituent of the blood, which contains all its impurities. Will the public,
then, place confidence in the physician who, when invited to cure them, would weaken
them by bleeding, and <i>assist</i> the operations of nature by <i>depriving</i> her of that vital fluid, on the existence of which her powers of self-restoration
depend? Will they prefer a system which ensures a long convalesence to the patient,
to that in which he recovers from his disease without any sensible diminution of his
strength, or injury to his constitution? In short, the operation of wet-sheet packing
is so extraordinary and satisfactory in its results, that he who refuses to make use
of it must lag behind, whilst success will attend the efforts of him who judiciously
applies it in the cases to which it is suited.
</p>
<p>The compress and hot stupe, next demand our attention; both are usually applied to
the stomach; the latter consisting of a vulcanized India-rubber bag filled with hot
water, which is laid over a towel, the under folds of which are moistened and placed
next the body, a most efficient and convenient form of fomentation; these remedies
are applied in the treatment of nearly all chronic diseases, where there is morbid
action of the stomach, liver, or kidneys; this form of stupe, Dr. Wilson calls the
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“<i>Ne plus ultra</i> of poulticing, soothing and derivation being by it most perfectly obtained, and in
the greatest degree. Each operation has on deep seated chronic irritation, as one
of its qualities, the advantageous effect of a mild blister or mustard plaister, without
any of its drawbacks, and in acute inflammations, in all nervous or neuralgic pains,
in the sufferings of colic, biliousness, or sickness of the stomach, or other digestive
derangements from dietetic errors, and in the malaise ushering in fevers and inflammations,
in sore throat, &amp;c., or affections of the lungs and air tubes, it is then found to
be the most agreeable and potent anodyne and equalizer of the circulation.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>It, in effect, accomplishes the most salutary operations of opiates, without any risk
of congesting the liver, or producing that sickness and atony of the stomach, and
all but paralysis of the lower bowels which result from the use of narcotic drugs.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“No nervous irritations,” says Dr. Wilson, “no visceral congestions, especially if
of recent formation, but are soon relieved by this powerful <i>revulsive rubefacient</i> and <i>anodyne</i>. With the dissipation of those interior <span class="pageNum" id="pb15">[<a href="#pb15">15</a>]</span>congestions comes the solution of pains and spasms, or flatulence which may have risen
to a severe state of suffering, the release of bilious and nervous headaches, neuralgic
pains, asthmatic fits, &amp;c. These have all their origin near or remote in visceral
obstructions, congestions, &amp;c. In most cases where for a longer or a shorter time
any organic action has been embarrassed, sleep banished or disquieted, and the patient
irritated and exhausted to the last degree; by aid of the fomentations, in a brief
time organic calm takes the place of organic tumult, ease succeeds to agitation, and
the whole apparatus feels to work normally and with renewed alacrity. What I have
just described, you may frequently hear repeated and descanted upon in the same strain
by my patients.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>The effect of the hot-stupe in the removal of irritation from the viscera, the immediate
cause of dysentery, &amp;c., is very remarkable, and from our knowledge of its effects,
we have often regretted that so simple and rational an expedient was not resorted
to, in the treatment of those diseases by which our noble army was more than decimated
in the late Crimean Campaign. On this subject Dr. Wilson remarks—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“So strong was my conviction, that I wrote to my good friend Lord Rokeby, requesting
him to offer my service through Mr. Sidney Herbert. I offered to go and remain there
(at Scutari) entirely at my own expense, not as a ‘water doctor,’ but as an ordinary
medical practitioner, willing to lend a hand, and make himself generally useful. I
stated that I had almost lived in hospitals for seven years, had afterwards witnessed
the practice of nearly every great hospital in Europe, and could undertake simple
operations, and any amputations with little preparation: had been twenty-five years
in practice. After some weeks I received a polite letter thanking me, but fearing
it could not be done, not being quite the custom. About this time there was an outcry
for medical men, those at the hospitals were too few for the work, they were worn
out with fatigue.”</p>

</p>
<p>Further on he adds—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“I have had a great many patients suffering under Chronic diseases from climate, exposure,
and want of care, &amp;c., patients from India, Ceylon, and the Antipodes, with long continued
diarrhœa, dysentery, and intractable fever of an intermittent character. From the
success of this simple treatment in those cases, I have not ceased to regret that
I did not go to Scutari on my own account without permit or introduction. I might
have introduced the practice gradually, being sure that it only required a trial to
have been adopted by the medical staff with great satisfaction.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>We join Dr. Wilson heartily in this regret, as it would have led to the introduction
of this remedy if proved efficient, and silenced its advocates if it proved a failure.
Nowhere could the two systems have been more severely and satisfactorily tested, and
we should all have benefited by the result; the relative merits of the two systems
would have been decided, and the public no longer left to hang in doubt between them.

<p>The sitz bath and foot bath come next in point of importance. <span class="pageNum" id="pb16">[<a href="#pb16">16</a>]</span>The former acts with marked effect in cases of congestion of the liver and other internal
organs; by abstracting heat from the surface of the body submitted to its influence,
it causes a transference of fluids from the centre to the exterior, and the congested
organs are relieved from their excess of blood by its being thus determined to the
surface; this effect, at first temporary, becomes <i>permanent</i> when the use of the bath has been persevered in for some time. Let us now compare
the effects of this bath, in the cases of congestion of the liver, with the treatment
usually pursued by the orthodox physicians. Their remedies consist in dosing with
Calomel, or Taraxacum, or in the application of leeches to the affected region. The
two former stimulate the action of the liver, in spite of the congested blood which
oppresses it, but they do not attempt to deal with the causes of this congestion,
the result of which is that the liver being weakened by its unnatural exertions consequent
on the unnatural stimulants which have been administered to it, sinks—after the effect
of the unnatural stimulus has worn away—into a more enfeebled and exhausted state,
and the original cause of the congestion remaining unremoved, matters become worse
than at first. In the case of leeching, the topical bleeding relieves the affection
<i>for a time</i>, but this is a remedy which cannot be <span class="asc">REPEATED</span> in consequence of the weakness which it engenders, and when the bleeding is given
up, how do matters stand? The <i>disease</i> remains in <i lang="la">statu quo</i>; not so, however, the constitution, for this has been weakened by the bleeding, and
nature being consequently less able to cure herself, <i>chronic</i> disease of the liver results. On the other hand, the hydropathic treatment necessary
to determine the blood from the congested organ to the surface, and so remove the
disease, can be repeated as often as desirable, with constantly increasing effect,
until permanent relief is afforded by a perseverance in the treatment, and the patient
improves in general health, <i lang="la">pari passu</i>, with the cure of his particular disease. The effects of the sitz bath, are, it appears,
either tonic or relaxing according to the length of time during which it is administered;
if a tonic effect is desired, a period varying from ten to fifteen minutes is prescribed—if
a relaxing or derivative effect is to be produced, the period is extended to half-an-hour
or forty-five minutes.
</p>
<p>We should have thought it superfluous to make any observations on the evil effects
of mercury, which we thought were <span class="pageNum" id="pb17">[<a href="#pb17">17</a>]</span>acknowledged by everybody, were it not that we recently heard it designated by a much
respected physician as “a most wholesome substance,” the chief objection to it being
“that persons got too fat upon it.” This opinion astonished us not a little, and we
felt that when habit<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e557src" href="#xd32e557">5</a> and prejudice could so pervert the mind of a physician as to make him look upon a
poisonous substance as a positive good, we could easily account for the difficulty
which has been always experienced in converting a medical man—for the unsatisfactory
state of the medical art, and its having so long pertinaciously followed the routine
practice of our ancestors. When a mind cannot perceive the difference between black
and white, it is in vain to place less obvious differences before it. We now quote
the opinion of Dietrich as to the effects of this “wholesome” ingredient, mercury,
for the benefit of the physician in question, and such of our readers as may hitherto
have agreed with him. He tells us that—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“Soon after salivation has been established, the blood exhibits an inflammatory crust;
at a later period <i>its colour deepens, and its coagulability is diminished; the proportion of clot, and,
therefore, of fibrin, to serum (or watery part) becomes smaller; the formation of
albumen and mucus sinks to that of serum; the whole organic formation of the patient
is less consistent and cohesive</i>.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>Which opinion is right, let the public judge. We will not prejudice their verdict
by any further observations of ours, but will merely ask them, if mercury be proved
unnecessary, how can its continued use be defended?
</p>
<p>Dr. Farre writes sportively as follows:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“A full, plethoric woman, of a purple-red complexion, consulted me *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* <i>I gave her mercury, and in six weeks blanched her as white as a lily.</i>”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>If this be what the Allopathist boasts of, and one of the effects he aims at producing,
we congratulate him on the melancholy success which usually attends his efforts.
</p>
<p>As regards the use of the foot bath, we may observe that the theory of its administration
subverts all our preconceived notions respecting the proper mode of treating those
affections for which it is usually prescribed. For instance, the old mode of proceeding
in affections of blood to the head, or in cases of cold feet, was to apply cold to
the head and warmth to the feet, in the shape of hot flannels, hot bricks, and hot
stupes. <span class="pageNum" id="pb18">[<a href="#pb18">18</a>]</span>Now the Hydropathic mode of treatment is the very reverse of this, viz., to bathe
the head in tepid, and place the feet in cold water to about the depth of three inches,
up to the <span class="corr" id="xd32e581" title="Source: ancles">ankles</span>—friction of the feet accompanying their immersion; the whole being continued for
about ten minutes. Let any person suffering from cold feet try this remedy, and he
will satisfy himself of the truth of the principles which enjoin it. Its rationale
is as follows:—The application of warm water to the head, of the same temperature
as the body, does not increase the flow of blood to it, whilst the subsequent evaporation
from the moist and warm surface of the head cools it gradually, and so diminishes
the flow of blood to it, whilst the cold application to the feet, has, “for a secondary
result, the attraction and retention in those parts of great quantity of blood, and
consequently of increased temperature there. In fact,” continues Dr. Gully, “a cold
foot bath of twelve or fifteen minutes, <i>followed</i> by a walk of <i>half-an-hour</i>, is the most certain way to warm the feet that can be devised; just as, per contra,
the most certain way to <i>insure cold feet</i>, is to soak them in <i>hot</i> water. The same applies to the hands. When the patient is in a condition to take
it, a walk is necessary to obtain the circulating reaction alluded to:” he adds, “the
warmth remains for several hours. Very frequently I have heard persons say that they
have not known cold feet since they began to take cold foot baths.”
</p>
<p>With respect to bathing generally, very erroneous opinions appear to prevail, two
of which only we will notice:—First, that for delicate constitutions bathing is dangerous,
because no <i>reaction</i> takes place in the system;—secondly, that it is dangerous to bathe in cold water
when the body is heated. To the first we answer, that no matter how delicate the constitution
may be, reaction can <i>always be obtained</i>, if water of a <i>proper</i> temperature be used; this temperature will vary with the vitality of the individual—the
more delicate the individual the warmer the water must be. A delicate person will
often receive the same shock and benefit to his system from water at a temperature
of 80°, as a strong man may, perhaps, receive from water at a temperature of 42°.
To the second we reply, that a more erroneous opinion could not by possibility prevail,
and that the idea in question is <i>exactly the opposite of the truth</i>; the fact being, that the body cannot be too warm for cold bathing, always provided,
that such warmth has not been produced at the cost of bodily languor and fatigue,
as in such cases the system will be too much weakened to react after the <span class="pageNum" id="pb19">[<a href="#pb19">19</a>]</span>bath with effect; but with this exception, the <i>warmer the body</i> the <i>greater</i> will be the reaction and benefit received, and the longer may the bather continue
with impunity to luxuriate in the bath. The body is never so well calculated to withstand
the effects of cold as when it is heated; and the only danger to be apprehended from
cold bathing is that arising from entering the water in a chilled condition, when,
from the low vitality of the body, the subsequent reaction becomes imperfect. Let
these maxims be remembered:—that without subsequent reaction, no bath is beneficial—therefore,
water should be always used of a <i>proper</i> temperature to secure reaction, and exercise to warmth, taken immediately before
and after a cold bath, when practicable; that the colder the bath (provided reaction
follows) the greater its benefit, the reaction being always a mean proportional between
the temperature of the bather and the water in which he bathes. Whenever bathing is
found to disagree with any person, it will be always found that some of the preceding
conditions have been neglected, a very common fault being that of entering the water
in a chilled state, and remaining there for twenty minutes, when <i>five</i> would have proved, perhaps, more than sufficient; then headache, languor, and chilliness
succeed, and we are told that bathing disagrees. With <i>such</i> bathing, the wonder would be that it did not.
</p>
<p>We would next make some observations on the different modes of treating pulmonary
consumption, that fatal and mysterious disease, which has so long baffled the curative
efforts of the most eminent physicians of their day, and it is gratifying to find
that a great step towards a rational and successful mode of treatment, based on sound
physiological principles, has lately obtained in its case, which mode we hope soon
to see generally adopted by the medical profession.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e618src" href="#xd32e618">6</a> The unsuccessful treatment of this disease has hitherto cast a slur on medical science,
and it is not to be wondered at that little success should have attended on the orthodox
mode of treatment, since recent observation, and matured experience have shown, on
physiological principles, that no <i>worse</i> mode could have been devised for curing, nor a surer one adopted for aggravating
the disease. This new view of the matter is <span class="pageNum" id="pb20">[<a href="#pb20">20</a>]</span>very ably set forth in Dr. Lane’s work, which we heartily recommend to the perusal
of our readers, as a sensible and modest statement of the benefits resulting from
Hydropathic treatment in cases of that nature. Dr. Lane looks upon consumption as
essentially a <i>blood</i> disease, in which opinion he is confirmed by the first physiologists of the day,
and by those physicians who have had most experience in the treatment of that particular
disease, Sir James Clarke, Professor Bennet, Dr. Balbyrnie, and others. These physicians
concur in confirming the observation of others, to the effect that indigestion or
derangement of the stomach and digestive organs, is a universal forerunner of pulmonary
consumption, and that without such derangement consumption cannot exist. Consequent
on this diseased state of the digestive organs, imperfect blood is assimilated, <i>deficient</i> in its oleaginous elements, and containing an <i>undue</i> amount of albuminous materials; that in consequence of this deficiency of oleaginous
elements, the blood is incapable of being converted into true cellular tissue to replace
the effete material of the lungs, and the superabundant quantity of albumen has a
tendency to exude upon the lungs on their exposure to cold in the form of tubercles,
which process is unaccompanied by inflammatory action. These facts are based on long
observation and direct chemical analysis of the substance composing the tubercles,
which consist of almost pure albumen; and on this theory the wonderful effects of
cod liver oil in consumptive cases, and the great emaciation of body which results
from the disease are satisfactorily explained. In the one case, the cod liver oil
supplies, in a light and digestible form, the oleaginous element in which the blood
is deficient; in the other, the system has recourse to the fatty or adipose matter
of the body to supply the oleaginous principle. But now the question arises, supposing
that indigestion is the universal precursor of consumption, from what does this indigestion
and consequent imperfect assimilation of the blood proceed? This question Dr. Lane
does not touch upon, but we believe that Dr. Barter, the well-known Hydropathic physician
of Blarney, considers that it arises from defective vitality<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e639src" href="#xd32e639">7</a> in the blood, caused by deficiency of oxygen in the system, more immediately proceeding
<span class="pageNum" id="pb21">[<a href="#pb21">21</a>]</span>from defective capacity of the lungs, and imperfect action of the skin. The skin and
lungs, it must be remembered, are supplementary organs; stop the action of <i>either</i>, and death inevitably ensues, and on their perfect or imperfect action, perfect or
imperfect health depends. This view of the disease is illustrated by the history of
the monkey: in its wild state, the best authorities state, it never gets consumption,
but domesticate the animal, so inducing bad action of the lungs, from want of sufficient
exercise and wholesome air, and imperfect action of the skin, arising from the same
cause, and it usually dies of this disease. These observations equally apply to all
cases of scrofulous degeneration, which physicians estimate as carrying off prematurely
one-sixth of the whole human family.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e655src" href="#xd32e655">8</a> Of this terrible disease, the scourge of the human race, it is sufficient to observe,
that consumption is merely a form of it, and that it is, moreover, <i>hereditary</i>, a fact which would corroborate the opinion of its being a true <i>blood</i> disease.
</p>
<p>Having referred to the fact of the lungs and skin being supplementary organs—the principal
duty of both being to <i>aerate</i> the blood—it may be interesting to lay before our readers the following extracts
from the results of Monsieur Fourcault’s experiments bearing on the subject. These
experiments were made with the view of ascertaining the effect of the suppression
of transpiration by the skin, in animals, on coating their bodies with an impermeable
varnish. The committee of the French Institute thus describes these experiments:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“The substances which he used were givet-glue, dextrine, pitch, and tar, and several
plastic compounds; sometimes the varnish was made to cover the whole of the animal’s
body, at other times only a more or less extensive part of it. The accidents which
follow this proceeding are more or less complete or incomplete, general or partial.
In every case the health of the animals is soon much impaired and their life in danger.
Those which have been submitted to those experiments, under our observation, have
died in one or two days, and in some cases <i>in a few hours only</i>.
</p>
<p>“In the opinion of the committee these experiments are full of interest <span class="pageNum" id="pb22">[<a href="#pb22">22</a>]</span>for the future, *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* the experiments of M. Fourcault cannot fail to throw a new
light upon the physiological and pathological phenomena, depending upon the double
function of <i>inhalation</i> and exhalation of the cutaneous system.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>Monsieur Fourcault himself thus writes:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“The mucous membranes were not the only parts affected by the artificial suppression
of the insensible perspiration. We also observed the production of serous effusions
in the pericardium, and even in the pleuræ. These effusions thus demonstrate that
dropsies are found in the same body as mucous discharges. Several dogs died with paraplegia,
and could only drag themselves along on their fore paws; some died <i>atrophied</i>, and their lungs contained miliary <i>tubercules</i>, which appeared to me, from their whiteness and softness, to be of <i>recent</i> formation. It was, therefore, now impossible to doubt the influence of the suppression
of the insensible perspiration of the skin upon the changes in the blood, the mucous
and serous exudations, and finally, upon the development of local lesions.
</p>
<p>“But the results of these experiments differ <i>in toto</i> according as the plastering is partial or general, or as it suspends the action of
the skin incompletely or completely. In the first case, the alteration of the blood
is not carried so far as to cause the dissolution of its organic elements; it can
coagulate, and present, in some few cases, a buffy coat of little consistency, bearing
some resemblance to that which is found in inflammatory blood. As to the tissues affected,
they, however, appear to me to present the anatomical characteristics of the consequences
of local inflammation.
</p>
<p>“But when the application of very adhesive substances upon the <i>whole</i> of the body quickly suppresses the cutaneous exhalation, and consequently prevents
the action of the air upon the skin, death takes place much more speedily, and appears
to be the result of <i>true <span class="corr" id="xd32e706" title="Source: asphxyia">asphyxia</span></i>. The breathing of the animals experimented upon, is difficult; they take deep inspirations,
in order to inhale a larger quantity of air than usual; their death is violent, and
is often accompanied by convulsive movements. On dissection, we find in the veins
and the right cavities of the heart, sometimes also in the left, but very rarely in
the arteries, a black diffluent blood, forming sometimes into soft and diffluent coagula,
and coagulating, very imperfectly, when exposed to atmospherical air. This dissolution
of the blood, favours the formation of large ecchymoses and of effusions into the
lungs and other organs, the capillary vessels are usually injected;—one can see that
the alteration of the blood has been the true cause of the stagnation of the circulation
in this order of vessels. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
</p>
<p>“It is important to state that man, in the same way as animals, dies from <i>cutaneous asphyxia</i> when his body is covered by impermeable applications. I shall detail, in another
work, the results of my researches upon this subject, and facts which still belong
to general history will enter into the province of medicine. Thus, at Florence, when
Leo&nbsp;X. was raised to the pontificate, a child was gilt all over, in order to represent
the golden age. This unfortunate child soon died, the victim of a physiological experiment
of a novel kind. I have gilded, silvered, and tinned several guinea-pigs, and all
have died like the child at Florence.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb23">[<a href="#pb23">23</a>]</span></p>
<p>Monsieur Fourcault, in summing up his researches, remarks as follows:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“Nasal catarrh, diarrhœa, paralysis, marasmus, convulsive movements, and finally the
phenomena of <i>asphyxia</i> are also the results of the same experiments. Cutaneous asphyxia may cause the death
of man and animals; in this affection, the blood presents, in the highest degree,
the refrigerant and <span class="corr" id="xd32e723" title="Source: stupifying">stupefying</span> qualities of <span class="asc">VEINOUS</span><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e728src" href="#xd32e728">9</a> blood.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>The above extracts are our answer to those superficial medical objectors, who would
argue that death is not occasioned, in the above instances, by the exclusion of atmospheric
air from the system, but by the suppression of poisonous salts secreted in the skin.
The effects of the suppression of the most poisonous and irritating of these is well
known to the physician, but their phenomena bear no analogy to those presented in
the case before us, which exhibits all the symptoms and appearance of true <i>suffocation</i>. If, however, the evidence of these experiments be not sufficient to convince them,
that a deficient supply of air, producing suffocating symptoms, was the real cause
of death in the above cases, we will be prepared to meet them on a more convenient
battle-field, where arguments, which would only prove tedious and unintelligible to
the non-professional reader, may be freely adduced in support of our position.
</p>
<p>Were it not tedious to multiply instances, many more might be adduced, such as the
dangerous stage of small-pox being contemporaneous with the <i>breaking</i> of the pustules, when the surface of the body becomes partially varnished over, and
the fact that a scald or burn is dangerous, not in proportion to its <i>depth</i>, but <i>breadth</i>.
</p>
<p>Now, if it be conceded that the main cause of consumption, tracing the disease back
to its first cause, is to be found in an insufficient supply of oxygen to the system
(which certainly the success attendant on the treatment based upon this theory would
lead one to suppose), we would beg of our readers seriously to ask themselves how
can consumption be cured by drugging, and how can the much required oxygen be supplied
to the blood by any proceeding of the kind? We think that the results of such a system
afford a conclusive answer to this question; failure marking its course wherever it
has been tried. Again, as regards the fashionable remedy of <span class="pageNum" id="pb24">[<a href="#pb24">24</a>]</span>going abroad,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e748src" href="#xd32e748">10</a> how are we likely to get more oxygen supplied to our blood by going abroad than by
staying at home? What magic is there in the process? A mild climate may certainly
prove less irritating than its native air to a diseased and disordered lung, and the
suffering and uneasiness consequent on the irritation may be thereby allayed, but
we are not a whit nearer being <i>cured</i> by this device, nor have we, in so doing, properly gone to work to remove the main
spring and cause of the disease.
</p>
<p>Let our readers bear in mind the following aphorism of Dr. Hall: “Close bed rooms
make the graves of multitudes;” let them recollect that impure blood is the origin
of consumption, and that <i>impure</i> air causes <i>impure</i> blood.
</p>
<p>Carrying out these principles, in curing consumption, Dr. Barter would use all means
to place the system in a favourable condition to receive <i>a full supply of oxygen</i>, first, by a direct inhalation of a mixture of oxygen and atmospheric air through
the lungs; secondly, by enjoining a large amount of active exercise in the open air,
when practicable, and sleeping at night with open windows; and thirdly, by inducing
a healthy action of the skin,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e767src" href="#xd32e767">11</a> and consequent supply, through it, of oxygen to the blood, by the intervention of
the Turkish bath. This mode of treatment has, we believe, proved most <i>successful</i>, whilst the old mode of treatment, of which it is the very antipodes, viz., keeping
the patient in a heated and impure atmosphere, swathing him with flannels,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e772src" href="#xd32e772">12</a> dosing him <span class="pageNum" id="pb25">[<a href="#pb25">25</a>]</span>with prussic acid, and applying a respirator to the mouth, has proved most unsuccessful
and fatal. How it could ever have entered into the brain of a physician to recommend
the use of a respirator, as a cure for consumption, we are at a loss to imagine, as
a more ingenious mode of shutting out the pure atmosphere, essential to our existence,
and exchanging it for one loaded with carbonic acid (thus aggravating the disease
which it seeks to cure), could not possibly be devised. Man, in a state of health,
requires pure air as a condition of his existence; and can it be supposed that, in
a state of <i>disease</i>, he will be able, <i>more successfully</i>, to resist the effects of poison on his system than when in a state of health? Will
he, in a state of disease, be strengthened and improved by the loss of that, on a
due supply of which, when well, the continuance of his health and strength would depend?
Does the experience of our readers furnish them with a single case of recovery from
consumption caused by the use of a respirator, or does it not, on the contrary, furnish
them, in every case where it has been resorted to, with instances of the bad effects
attendant upon its use?
</p>
<p>In support of the view taken by Dr. Barter, we would observe, that <i>narrow and contracted lungs, an impure atmosphere, uncleanly habits, sedentary occupation,
indulgence in alcoholic liquors, and over eating</i>, all directly tend to the overloading of the blood with carbon, and they are also
the most constant causes of consumption. But the <i>success</i> attending this treatment is the argument which will have most weight with the public,
and cause its adoption by the profession at large. When this takes place we shall
not have consumptive patients sent abroad to seek restoration of their health—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“To Nice, where more <i>native</i> persons die of consumption than in any English town of equal population—to Madeira,
where no local disease is more prevalent than consumption—to Malta, where one-third
of the deaths amongst our troops are caused by consumption—to Naples, whose hospitals
record a mortality, from consumption, of one in two and one-third of the patients—nor,
finally, to Florence, where pneumonia is said to be marked by a suffocating character,
and a rapid progress towards its final stage. Sir James Clarke has assailed with much
force the doctrine, that change of climate is beneficial in cases of consumption.
M. Carriere, a French physician, has written strongly against it. Dr. Burgess, an
eminent Scotch physician, also contends that climate has little or nothing to do with
the cure of consumption, and that if it had, the curative effects would be produced
through the skin and not the lungs, by opening the pores, and promoting a <i>better aeration</i> of the blood.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>With respect to the administering of prussic acid, to lower <span class="pageNum" id="pb26">[<a href="#pb26">26</a>]</span>the pulse in consumption, we cannot <span class="asc">TOO STRONGLY</span> reprobate this mistaken practice. Do physicians, when prescribing this poison, ever
reflect that this elevation of the pulse, which they employ themselves so sedulously
to lower, is an effort of nature to supply more oxygen to the system by an <i>increased</i> action of the lungs, and that the <i>more</i> the lungs are injured by disease, the <i>greater</i> is this compensating effort of nature: just as a blacksmith must work a <i>small</i> or defective bellows <i>more</i> rapidly than a large one, to keep his fire going. If this be the case, the destructive
effects of prussic acid will at once be evident, since by it all the powers of the
system become reduced, and nature’s efforts at self-relief <i>most mischievously</i> obstructed. The feverish action of the pulse is, in <i>itself</i>, of no moment; it is only as a <i>symptom</i> of derangement in the system that it becomes alarming; it is nature telling us that
something is wrong by the very action which she is establishing to cure it. What then
must be thought of a practice which silences the tell-tale pulse, stops the voice
of nature, and <i>checks</i> her curative efforts, without attempting to <i>cure</i> the disorder; doing immense mischief, whilst it effects no good? The fact is, the
only reduction of the pulse which is worth a farthing, is that which <i>follows naturally</i> from removing the <i>cause</i> of its elevation, viz., a want of oxygen in the system. That the supplying of this
want has the effect of <i>lowering</i> the consumptive pulse, without the assistance of prussic acid, is abundantly proved
by the rapid fall of the pulse produced by the Turkish bath,—a result most satisfactory
to the physiologist, as evidencing the soundness of the theory which prescribes it
as a remedy.
</p>
<p>Having referred to the erroneous practice of swathing consumptive patients in flannel,
it may not be out of place here to make a few observations on the origin of caloric
in the animal system, and the office of clothing in relation to it.
</p>
<p>The only true source of caloric in animals, is that produced by the chemical combination
of oxygen with the carbon and other oxidizable products of their system. Every cause
which quickens and exalts this chemical action increases the animal heat, whilst every
interfering cause produces cold and chilliness. It is in this way that drinking cold
water, or taking exercise in the open air, increases the warmth of the body, by producing
a healthy<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e834src" href="#xd32e834">13</a> waste of the system, and so stimulating the chemical <span class="pageNum" id="pb27">[<a href="#pb27">27</a>]</span>combustion within it. Clothing, it should be recollected, has merely the effect of
<i>retaining</i> animal heat and <i>preventing</i> its dissipation, but it cannot, in the slightest degree, <i>create</i> it: if, therefore, any thing occurs to interfere with that action, by which heat
can alone be generated, all the clothes in the world will fail to warm us. How little
these facts are reflected on, is shown by the excessive and injurious amount of clothing
worn by delicate persons, which defeats the very object they are intended to effect.
These facts also explain the apparent paradox of patients who, previous to undergoing
the water system, complain of chilliness when smothered with clothing, but who afterwards
are enabled to wear very light clothing, without any feeling of their former chilliness.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e846src" href="#xd32e846">14</a> On this subject Dr. Gully observes:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“Should, however, the reader desire to learn <i>the most effectual way of destroying the power of generating animal heat</i>, let him pursue the plan which so many shivering patients who come to Malvern have
followed. Let him drink spirits and wine, eat condiments, swallow purgatives, and
especially mercurials, take a ‘course of iodine,’ and, as an occasional interlude,
lose a little blood, and we stake our reputation that he will shiver to his heart’s
content, and find himself many degrees lower in the scale of Fahrenheit than cold
water, cool air, early rising, and exercise can possibly make him.”</p>

<p>Before leaving this subject, we would entreat our readers seriously to consider the
observations we have addressed to them, and the facts which we have adduced in support
of the mode of treatment which we have advocated. The subject is one of serious moment,
since, on this disease being rightly understood, the lives of millions of our countrymen
depend. If a rational mode of treatment be adopted, its fearful ravages may be successfully
encountered and stayed, but if not, the gaunt spectre will stalk as hitherto, unchecked
through the length and breadth of our island, dealing death to millions of its sons.
</p>
<p>With regard to water drinking, an important part of the Hydropathic process, and against
which much prejudice exists, the following extracts from the pen of the justly celebrated
Allopathic physician, Sir Henry Holland, will not, we hope, be considered out of place.
In his work styled “Medical Notes and Reflections,” treating of “Diluents,” he thus
writes:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“Though there may seem little reason for considering these as a separate class of
remedies, yet I doubt whether the principles of treatment <span class="pageNum" id="pb28">[<a href="#pb28">28</a>]</span>implied in the name is sufficiently regarded in modern practice. On the Continent,
indeed, the use of diluents is much more extensive than in England; and, under the
form of mineral waters especially, makes up in some countries a considerable part
of general practice. But putting aside all question as to mineral ingredients in water,
the consideration more expressly occurs, to what extent and with what effects this
great diluent, the only one which really concerns the animal economy, may be introduced
into the system as a remedy? Looking at the definite proportion which, in a healthy
state, exists in all parts of the body between the aqueous, saline, and animal ingredients—at
the various organs destined, directly or indirectly, to regulate the proportion—and
at the morbid results, occurring whenever it is materially altered—we must admit the
question as one very important in the animal economy, and having various relation
to the causes and treatment of disease. Keeping in mind then this reference to the
use of water as an internal remedy, diluents may be viewed under three conditions
of probable usefulness:—First, the mere mechanical effect of quantity of liquid in
diluting and washing away matters, excrementitious or noxious, from the alimentary
canal;—secondly, their influence in modifying certain morbid conditions of the blood;—and
thirdly, their effect upon various functions of secretion and excretion, and especially
upon those of the kidneys and skin *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* The first is an obvious benefit in many cases,
and not to be disdained from any notion of its vulgar simplicity. It is certain there
are many states of the alimentary canal in which the free use of water at stated times
produces good, which cannot be attained by other or stronger remedies. I have often
known the action of the bowels to be maintained with regularity for a long period,
simply by a tumbler of water, warm or cold, on an empty stomach, in cases where medicine
had almost lost its effect, or become a source only of distressing irritation. The
advantage of such treatment is still more strongly attested, where the secretions
taking place into the intestines, or the products formed there during digestion, become
vitiated in kind. Here dilution lessens that irritation to the membranes, which we
cannot so readily obviate by other means, and aids in removing the cause from the
body with less distress than any other remedy. In some cases, where <i>often</i> and <i>largely</i> used, its effect goes farther in actually altering the state of the secreting surfaces
by direct application to them. I mention these circumstances upon experience, having
often obtained much good from resorting to them in practice, when stronger medicines
and ordinary methods had proved of little avail. Dilution thus used, for example,
so as to act on the contents of the bowels, is beneficial in many dyspeptic cases,
where it is especially an object to avoid needless irritation to the system. Half-a-pint
or more of water taken when fasting, at the temperature most agreeable to the patient,
will often be found to give singular relief to his morbid sensations. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* In reference
to the foregoing uses of diluents, it is to be kept in mind that the lining of the
alimentary canal is, to all intents, a surface, as well as the skin, pretty nearly
equal in extent; exercising some similar functions, with others more appropriate to
itself, and capable in many respects of being acted upon in a similar manner. As respects
the subject before us, it is both expedient and correct in many cases to regard diluents
as acting on this internal surface analogously to liquids on the skin. And I would
apply this remark not only to the mechanical effects of the remedy, but also to their
use as the medium for conveying cold to internal parts; a point <span class="pageNum" id="pb29">[<a href="#pb29">29</a>]</span>of practice which either the simplicity of the means, or the false alarms besetting
it, have hitherto prevented from being duly regarded.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>Again he writes:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“Without reference, however, to these extreme cases, it must be repeated, that the
use of water, simply as a diluent, scarcely receives attention and discrimination
enough in our English practice.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>And again:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“As I have been treating of this remedy only in its simplest form, I do not advert
to the use of the different mineral waters farther than to state, that they confirm
these general views, separating, as far as can be done, their effect as diluents from
that of the ingredients they contain. The copious employment of some of them in Continental
practice gives room for observation, which is wanting under our more limited use.
I have often seen five or six pints taken daily for some weeks together (a great part
of it in the morning while fasting), with singular benefit in many cases to the general
health, and most obviously to the state of the secretions. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* These courses, however,
were always conjoined with ample <i>exercise</i> and regular habits of life; doubtless influencing much the action of the waters,
and aiding their salutary effect.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>With this quotation we take leave of Sir Henry Holland, merely observing, that no
Hydropathist could say more on the subject than he has done, and that the Continental
practice referred to, of drinking large quantities of water, conjoined with ample
exercise and regular habits of life, is precisely that practice which Hydropathy enjoins.
</p>
<p>Sir John Forbes, a physician already quoted, says, on water drinking—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“The water cure is a <i>stomachic</i>, since it invariably increases the appetite.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>Dr. Pereira states—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“It is a vital stimulus, and is more essential to our existence than aliment.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>Liebig, the celebrated physiological chemist, bears similar testimony, viz.—“It increases
the appetite.”
</p>
<p>Are these effects consistent with lowering the tone of the stomach? are they not,
on the contrary, the strongest evidence of the <span class="asc">TONIC</span> effects of water?
</p>
<p>Some objectors say, “water drinking thins the blood.” After demolishing these objections
by arguments which we regret we have not space to quote, Dr. Gully concludes his observations
as follows;—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“But the whole assertion regarding thin blood proceeds on grounds that betray intense
ignorance, both of physiology and of the water cure. It supposes that the whole water
imbibed enters into, and remains in the circulating blood, <i>quasi</i> water, that no chemical transformation of it takes <span class="pageNum" id="pb30">[<a href="#pb30">30</a>]</span>place in the body at all: this is ignorance of physiology. And it supposes that <span class="asc">ALL</span> who are treated by water are told to drink the same, and that a large quantity, without
discrimination of the individual cases of disease presented: this is ignorance of
the water cure. So between the horns of this compound ignorance, and of wilful misrepresentation,
we leave the declaimers about the ‘thinning of the blood.’ ”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>It is a curious fact that in all the medical works which treat of anaemia, or bloodlessness,
“allusion is never once made to water-drinking as a known cause—not even to the possibility
of its being a cause of it.”
</p>
<p>In so flagrant a case of thin blood, why has this <i>principal</i> cause been omitted? It is further curious that this injurious effect of water was
never invented, much less preached, until Hydropathy was found to be making inconvenient
strides in public favour.
</p>
<p>Is the reader aware that <i>eighty per cent.</i> of water enters into the composition of healthy blood, without making any allowance
for the enormous quantity required for the various secretions?
</p>
<p>Granting, however, for the sake of argument, that all, and <i>more</i> than these objectors urge, were true, we still have a kind of feeling that water
is more congenial to the system than prussic acid, or even iodine. But we may be wrong.
</p>
<p>Perhaps there is no disease which would appear, at first sight, so little suited for
Hydropathic treatment as cholera;<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e933src" href="#xd32e933">15</a> that disease for the successful treatment of which we have been hitherto accustomed
to consider stimulants and hot applications of all kinds as indispensably necessary,
and yet there is no disease, in the treatment of which Hydropathy has been more successful.
</p>
<p>The principles of its treatment, by the water system, are so sensibly and rationally
put forward in the pamphlet entitled, “An Address, &amp;c.,” that, as we think, the greatest
sceptic must be convinced of the truth of the doctrines it propounds, we strongly
recommend its perusal to our readers. Of the many cases treated by the author, <span class="asc">ALL</span>, we are told, recovered, whilst not a single instance of secondary fever—the invariable
accompaniment of the Allopathic treatment, and only secondary in danger to the disease
itself—occurred. The necessary prevalence of this secondary fever in the one case,
and its <span class="pageNum" id="pb31">[<a href="#pb31">31</a>]</span>absence in the other, are beautifully explained, on natural principles, at pages 9
and 10. Though the pamphlet in question is anonymous, and the author has taken some
pains to explain his reason for concealing his name, yet he has unwittingly betrayed
his identity in the following extract from a letter from Lieut.-Colonel Cummins, <span class="asc">C.M.</span>, who, having tried the system as an amateur, in America, thus writes of it:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“Tell Barter that his system has lately become the universal practice in the Southern
States, for cholera; <i>and since its adoption, although it is, of course, but imperfectly carried out, the
mortality is not one-fourth</i>.
</p>
<p>“I never saw cholera of so frightful a character; that at Quebec, which you recollect
was so near doing for me, was nothing to it; the violence of the spasms was such that
blood oozed out through all the pores of the skin, especially with the niggers. It
did not give the slightest warning; the men often fell while at work, and before four
hours were dead.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>The following statement, extracted from a letter written by Mr. James Morgan of Cork,
and which appeared in the <i>Limerick Chronicle</i>, 4th April, 1849, affords a remarkable instance of the beneficial effects of fresh
air and cold water, so strongly insisted upon by Dr. Barter, and corroborating the
practice which, on theoretical grounds, he recommends:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“In a temporary cholera hospital at Gloucester, there were sixteen patients, one of
whom was an interesting young female, between fifteen and sixteen years of age, for
whose recovery the attending physician (Dr. Shute) was most anxious. On leaving the
hospital in the evening, the girl was in collapse, and quite blue; he called the nursetender,
and bade her be attentive to her, and give her whatever she may call for, as all hopes
had vanished. In the course of the night the nurse went to increase the fire which
was near the girl’s berth in the ward; but she begged the woman not to do so, as she
was almost suffocated, and, at the same time, asked for a drink. The nurse brought
her a bowl of tea, which was rejected, but she requested water. Remembering the doctor’s
directions, the nurse, not without some reluctance and apprehension, brought her a
pint mug full of water, which she drank with avidity; and continued to call for water
about every five minutes, until she had taken two gallons of it; when she fell into
a profound sleep, in which she was found by the doctor in the morning, when her natural
complexion reappeared, and she was, to his astonishment, in a state of convalescence.
Having with amazement elevated his eyes, exclaiming, ‘this is something like a miracle!’
he called the nursetender, who related what had taken place; and perceiving the window
open over the patient’s berth, he asked why it was not shut? and was told by the attendant,
that it was left open at the earnest desire of the girl. The doctor immediately ordered
all the windows of the ward to be opened, the heavy bed covering on the patients to
be removed, and replaced by light rugs; directed that no drink should be given but
<i>cold water</i>, and the result was, that the whole sixteen persons were cured of cholera; one, however,
died of consecutive fever, produced by eating too much chicken and drinking too much
broth whilst convalescent. The case <span class="pageNum" id="pb32">[<a href="#pb32">32</a>]</span>was reported to the Government Board of Health, then sitting in London; and similar
treatment was pursued by all the medical men in and about Gloucester with the most
complete success. The report, names of the doctors, and all the correspondence are
minutely detailed in the columns of the <i>Chronicle</i> in the year 1832.
</p>
<p>“Need more be offered upon the subject; and yet with such facts upon record, ‘hot
punch’ is now given to the poor patients in the cholera hospitals in Limerick. Those
pious and angelic Sisters of Mercy, to whom you have alluded in the <i>Chronicle</i>, never, in all probability, heard or read of the treatment of cholera as above narrated;
but ever attentive and observant as they are in the performance of their hallowed
vocation, they have not been unmindful of the good effects of cold water. Nature prompts
the sufferer to call for it, and it should be always supplied. In cholera, pure water
is balsamic.
</p>
<p>“As to the operation of cold water on the human system in cholera, or the action of
the system on water, I will not presume to pronounce; but I may say that it is commonly
supposed that when the serum (one of the important constituents of the blood) is exhausted
by discharges, collapse takes place, and the livid hue of the countenance follows;
and everybody has heard of the experimental operation of transfusion of warm water,
combined with albumen and soda, into the veins, to supply the absence of serum, in
order to give the vital current its natural and healthy flow: whether cold water,
from the oxygen it contains, and the necessary heat it is therefore calculated to
impart, is taken up rapidly by the absorbents to cherish and feed the blood, and fill
the channels of circulation, so as to remove collapse in cholera, I shall leave physiologists
to determine; but it is indisputable that cholera patients have anxiously asked for,
and eagerly swallowed, copious draughts of cold water, till their thirst was allayed,
genial warmth restored, agony banished, and the vital functions vivified and invigorated.”
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>The following extract is taken from Braithnorth’s “Retrospect of Medicine,” a standard
professional work:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“I am acquainted with three persons, who, after they had been laid out for dead, on
being washed, previous to interment, in the open court-yard, with water, to obtain
which the ice had been broken, recovered in consequence, and lived many years. I received
from Erycroon, in Turkey, a letter from our excellent Consul, Mr. Brant, who states
that Dr. Dixon, of that place, was then curing more patients by friction, with ice
or snow, than any other treatment. The same practice is reported to have been the
most effectual in Russia.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>We make no comments on the foregoing, leaving the public to draw their own conclusions
from the facts stated. In setting the facts before them, we feel we have done our
duty; we leave the leaven to work in their minds, and produce its own result on their
future conduct.
</p>
<p>In condemning the mistaken administration of hot stimulants, such as “hot punch,”
&amp;c., Dr. Barter proceeds:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“I never yet saw a patient that did not cry out for cold water; and the confirmed
dram-drinker can, with difficulty, be persuaded to taste his <span class="pageNum" id="pb33">[<a href="#pb33">33</a>]</span>favourite beverage; he objects more to brandy or punch than the temperate do; this
I have often remarked. I have seen a patient travel for miles on an open car, through
sleet and rain, without any covering, and drinking cold water on the way, and remarked
that he did better than when treated with brandy, hot tins, &amp;c. In fact, I often saw
such patients beg to be allowed out again, they used to call loudly for cold water.
‘<i>For the love and honour of God, sir, get us a drink of cold water</i>,’ was no unfrequent request amongst them, and that pronounced with an earnestness
of manner most truly impressive; but, alas! in 1832, this appeal was always refused,
though in 1849 a step has been taken in a right direction, and it is allowed, according
to the Sisters of Mercy, ‘in small quantities.’ ”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>The truth will ere long be acknowledged, that it is our <i>mode of life</i> that makes us fit subjects for cholera, and that it is our <i>mode of treating it</i> alone, which makes the disease so dangerous. The wretch who is cast uncared for in
a ditch, exposed to all the inclemency of the weather, with water alone to quench
his burning thirst, has ten chances to one in favour of his recovery, compared with
the well-cared patient who is dosed with brandy and the favourite specifics of the
apothecary’s shop. If we look at cholera, and divest our minds of its accustomed mode
of treatment, we will find that every symptom of the disease points to the presence
of some highly irritant poison in the blood; and in the effort to expel this poison,
the serum which contains it, is drained from the system. What, therefore, can be more
rational than to supply the system with the materials of restoration, by giving water
in large quantities, and to stimulate its chemical combinations by which the caloric
of the system shall be restored, by the influence of fresh air, water drinking, and
cold bathing.
</p>
<p>Sir Bulwer Lytton thus sums up his impressions of Hydropathy:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“Those cases in which the water-cure seems an absolute panacea, and in which the patient
may commence with the most sanguine hopes, are—first, rheumatism, however prolonged,
however complicated. In this the cure is usually rapid—nearly always permanent.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1003src" href="#xd32e1003">16</a> Secondly, gout: here its efficacy is little less startling to appearance than in
the former case; it seems to take up the disease by the roots; it extracts the peculiar
acid which often appears in discolorations upon the sheets used in the application,
or is ejected in other modes. But here, judging always from cases <span class="pageNum" id="pb34">[<a href="#pb34">34</a>]</span>subjected to my personal knowledge, I have not seen instances to justify the assertion
that returns of the disease do not occur. The predisposition—the tendency, has appeared
to remain; the patient is liable to relapses, but I have invariably found them far
less frequent, less lengthened, and readily susceptible of simple and speedy cure,
especially if the habits remain temperate.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>If it be asked why Hydropathy has proved itself so effective a remedy in curing rheumatism,
we would answer, on account of its great power in strengthening and invigorating the
stomach and digestive organs, in the derangement of which, the cause of that disease
is to be found. Rheumatism proceeds from a sluggish circulation in the extremities,
consequent on a low vitality in the system, arising from a derangement of the digestive
organs and viscera; if these latter were sound and <i>free from irritation</i>, all the cold and wet, we could possibly be exposed to, would fail to produce that
inflammation of the sheaths of the muscles in which rheumatism consists. That Hydropathy
is capable of strengthening and invigorating these organs, is well known to all who
have tried it, and is even admitted by its greatest opponents when they state, “Oh!
it is good for the general health,” for it is utterly impossible for the “general
health” to be good without a sound digestion.
</p>
<p>With respect to gout, a <i>permanent</i> cure from it is rarely to be found, and why?—Because few people have either the time
or patience to continue long enough under treatment for its <i>total</i> eradication, running away from an “establishment” the moment they get relief from
the pressing fit, and consequently the disease recurs. Now, of all diseases, gout
is perhaps the most tedious of <i>permanent</i> cure, the visceral irritation which gives rise to it being always inveterate and
of long duration, and nothing short of chronic treatment—treatment continuing for
years instead of months, will remove it. Dr. Gully observes respecting it:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“It would be folly, however, to avoid a treatment because it will not <i>for ever</i> root up your disease in your own convenient time. Look at the destructive manner
in which colchicum reduces a gouty fit, how it approximates the attacks, and utterly
disorganizes the viscera; and then regard what the water cure is capable of doing,
both against individual attacks, and in reduction of the diathesis, the vital parts
meanwhile improving under its operation; … if it does not utterly cure the gout, at
least it does not shorten the patient’s life as colchicum does.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>On the effects of colchicum he, further on, observes:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“To the patient, and, indeed, to the physician who knows little of physiology, all
this will appear right: the <i>gout</i> is removed, and that is what <span class="pageNum" id="pb35">[<a href="#pb35">35</a>]</span>was desired. The physician, however, who is a physiologist, will say, ‘True, that
irritation which you call <i>gout</i>, has left the <i>extremities</i>, whither it had been sent by nature to save her noble <i>internal</i> parts. But look to the signs exhibited by those parts; are they not those of augmented
irritation, at least of irritation of a degree and kind that did not exist so long
as the limbs were <i>pained</i> and <i>inflamed</i>? The fact is, that your colchicum has set up in the viscera so intense an irritation
as to reconcentrate the mischief within; and the fit is cured, not by ridding the
body of the gouty irritation, but by driving or drawing it in again,’ (thus <i>baffling</i> nature’s efforts at self relief). ‘Hence the continuance of the dyspeptic symptoms
after the fit; hence, as you will find, the recurrence of another fit ere long, the
intervals becoming less and less, until gouty pain is incessantly in the limbs, and
gouty irritation always in the viscera.’ ”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>When the drugging practitioner drives the inflammation from the extremities to a more
dangerous internal position, he congratulates himself on having cured the gout; but
what in reality has he done?—By his mischievous interference with nature, he has endangered
his patient’s life and shaken his constitution; whilst the gouty irritation, which
causes the complaint, remains unsubdued, ready to be transferred at a moment to the
head or heart, the practitioner having cleverly banished it from its original harmless
position. It is in this way also that the Allopathist <i>cures</i> skin diseases, <i>driving</i> in the irritation which nature is struggling to drive out; this he eventually succeeds
in doing, by <i>weakening</i> the powers of the system, and then fancies the disease is cured, whilst the patient
pays in the long run for these hostile operations against nature.
</p>
<p>But we have interrupted Sir Bulwer Lytton,—he thus proceeds:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“Thirdly, that wide and grisly family of affliction classed under the common name
of <i>dyspepsia</i>. <i>All derangements of the digestive organs</i>, imperfect powers of nutrition—the <i>malaise</i> of an injured stomach, appear precisely the complaints on which the system takes
firmest hold, and in which it effects those cures that convert existence from a burden
into a blessing.
</p>
<p>“Hence it follows that many nameless and countless complaints, proceeding from derangement
of the digestive organs, cease as that great machine is restored to order. I have
seen <i>disorders of the heart</i> which have been pronounced <i>organic</i> by no inferior authorities of the profession, disappear in an incredibly short time;
cases of incipient consumption, in which the seat is in the nutritious powers; hæmorrhages,
and various congestions, shortness of breath, habitual fainting fits, many of what
are called improperly nervous complaints, but which in reality are radiations from
the main ganglionic spring: the disorders produced by the abuse of powerful medicines,
especially <i>mercury</i> and <i>iodine</i>; the loss of appetite, the dulled sense and the shaking hand of intemperance, skin
complaints, and the dire scourge of scrofula;—all these seem to obtain from Hydropathy
relief,—nay, absolute and unqualified cure, beyond not only the means of the most
skilful practitioner, but the hopes of the most sanguine patient.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb36">[<a href="#pb36">36</a>]</span></p>
<p>Nor will the above results form at all a subject for wonder, when it is remembered
that every natural disease arises either <i>from impurity in the blood or <span class="corr" id="xd32e1086" title="Source: mal-distribution">maldistribution</span> of it</i>, and that all the processes of the water cure, from the Turkish bath down to the
wet sheet, act powerfully as depurators of the blood and controllers of its circulation,—attracting
it here, and repelling it there, at will.
</p>
<p>We know not whether the public will prefer the <i>impartial</i> testimony of an intelligent observer like Sir Bulwer Lytton, to that of the Allopathic
physician, naturally wedded to his own system and anxious to sustain it against all
intruders; but we may observe, that we never yet met a physician <i>opposed to Hydropathy</i>, who did not, on catechising him, exhibit the most <span class="corr" id="xd32e1096" title="Source: absured">absurd</span> ignorance respecting it. Their chronic idea is that of a person being left to shiver
in wet sheets; and, as a consequence, their chronic note of warning, accompanied by
an ominous <span class="corr" id="xd32e1099" title="Source: skake">shake</span> of the head, consists in, “Don’t attempt the water cure, or it will kill you.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1102src" href="#xd32e1102">17</a> If medical men would but <i>see</i>, before they assert, then much value might be attached to their opinion; but what
value can be attached to their opinion about a system which they will not take the
trouble of examining into? How many orthodox physicians have ever visited Blarney,
or any similar Hydropathic establishment?—The proportion of such visitors (and no
one can form a fair idea of the system without seeing it at work), to the whole profession
would be more than represented by an infinitesimal fraction.
</p>
<p>We wonder how long the public will continue to poison<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1114src" href="#xd32e1114">18</a> their systems with mercury, colchicum, iodine, and prussic acid, because a physician
chooses to tell them that a mode of treatment which he has never investigated “will
kill them.”
</p>
<p>It may not be uninteresting to observe, that under Hydropathic treatment, chronic
disease frequently becomes acute; for, as the body improves in strength, the more
acutely will any <span class="pageNum" id="pb37">[<a href="#pb37">37</a>]</span>existing disease develop itself, and for the following reason: pain is caused by an
effort of nature to relieve the system of some morbid influence residing in it, and
the stronger the constitution, the greater efforts will it make to remove that morbid
influence, and therefore the greater will be the pain; but on the other hand, when
the body is enfeebled, its efforts to relieve itself, though continual, are weak and
inefficient, and the disease remaining in the system, assumes the chronic and less
painful form. Now with these facts before them, we have been amused at hearing physicians
observe, in their efforts to decry the “Water System,” “Oh it is good for the general
health, but nothing more,” a result albeit, which unfortunately the Allopathic system
cannot lay claim to. When speaking thus they do not however reflect that they are
affording the strongest possible testimony in support of the system which they seek
to decry, inasmuch as every physiologist, from Cape Clear to the Giant’s Causeway,
admits the principle, that the cure of disease is to be sought for in the powers of
the living organism <i>alone</i>; and it must be evident that the more you strengthen that organism, the more you
increase its powers to cure itself, and diminish its liability to future disease.
</p>
<p>Having trespassed thus far on the attention of our readers, we would conclude by inviting
them and the medical profession, generally, to a calm and dispassionate investigation,
as far as the opportunities of each allow, of the relative merits of the Allopathic
and Hydropathic systems, approaching the investigation, as far as possible, with a
mind devoid of prejudice and bigotry. Their duty to themselves and to society demands
this inquiry at their hands—two antagonistic (we use the term advisedly) systems are
presented for their acceptance—which will they lay hold of? To assist them in determining
this point we would recommend for their quiet perusal either or all of the works alluded
to in this article,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1131src" href="#xd32e1131">19</a> the study of which will be found interesting and profitable. If they conclude that
drugs are wholesome, let them by all means be swallowed; but if they are proved to
be injurious, deleterious and unnecessary, then away with them;—if opiates are innocuous
let them be retained, but if they congest the liver, sicken <span class="pageNum" id="pb38">[<a href="#pb38">38</a>]</span>the stomach, and paralyze the actions of the vital organs, the sooner they are erased
for ever from the Hygienic Pharmacopeia the better—let them gracefully retire before
the improved system of hot stupes, fomentations, and the abdominal compress.
</p>
<p>The very simplicity of the processes of the “water-cure,” which people cannot believe
capable of producing the effects ascribed to them, combined with a belief, ingrained
by long habit, in the absolute necessity for drugs in curing disease, have chiefly
militated against a more extended reception of Hydropathy by the lay public; but when
they reflect that <span class="asc">ALL</span> the powers of the medical art range themselves under two great categories, <i>stimulants and sedatives</i>—blistering, bleeding, drugs, and leeching—acknowledging no other objects, they cannot
but admit the <i>possibility</i> of Hydropathy possessing the powers attributed to it, since its bracing and soothing
properties cannot be questioned. Were, however, the position of affairs reversed,
and Hydropathy become as old a system as the Allopathic this belief, in the efficacy
of the old school might be securely entertained; for no one would think for a moment
of exchanging a system, fixed, intelligible, and certain in its action, as based on
scientific principles, and consonant with the laws of physiology, for the uncertain,
groping, empirical, and injurious practice of drug medication.
</p>
<p>We would ask the medical profession of Ireland to reflect on the fact, that Dr. Barter’s
establishment at Blarney, contains at this moment upwards of 120 patients, with many
more frequently seeking for admission within its walls, most of whom leave the establishment
ardent converts to Hydropathy, determined for the rest of their lives to “throw physic
to the dogs,” fleeing from it as from some poisonous thing. It will not do for them
to “pooh-pooh” the system, and tell their patients, as many of them do, that it will
kill them;<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1147src" href="#xd32e1147">20</a> <span class="pageNum" id="pb39">[<a href="#pb39">39</a>]</span>such language only betrays ignorance on their part, and will not put down a system
which daily gives the lie to their predictions by affording ocular demonstration of
its efficacy, in the restored health and blooming cheek of many a once emaciated friend.
Men are too sensible now-a-days to pin their faith on the dictum of a medical man,
who runs down a system without fairly investigating it, and examining the principles
on which it acts, to say nothing of the prejudice he must feel in favour of his own
particular system; but if a mode of treatment be rational, producing cures where every
other system of treatment has failed, and recommend itself to the common sense and
reason of mankind, we believe that such a principle will make its way despite of the
opposition of all the physicians that ever lived; and this very progress the water
cure is now making.
</p>
<p>We would in conclusion apostrophize Hydropathy, in the words of the American traveller,
who gave vent to his feelings on first beholding the falls of Niagara, by exclaiming,
“Well done, Water!!”

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p>What is a Turkish bath? Should this question be asked by any of our readers, we would
answer, that it is a bath differing from all other hot baths in this important particular,
viz., that the heated medium is <span class="asc">AIR</span> instead of water; and that all parts of the body, when in the bath, are subjected
to an even and equal temperature. The result of which is, that inasmuch as man was
constituted to breathe <span class="asc">AIR</span> instead of <i>vapour</i>, the Turkish bath may be enjoyed for hours at a time, without <span class="pageNum" id="pb40">[<a href="#pb40">40</a>]</span>inconvenience; whereas in the vapour-bath the patient is unable to remain in it for
more than about a quarter of an hour, in consequence of a feeling of suffocation,
from want of a sufficient supply of <i>air</i> to the lungs. And further, there is this difference between the two baths, that in
the case both of the vapour-bath and the vapour-<i>box</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1197src" href="#xd32e1197">2</a> the pulse is materially raised, whilst in the Turkish bath the pulse <i>seldom</i> rises above its normal state, which shows that the circulation is very little affected
by it—an all-important fact, which is thus accounted for:—The normal temperature of
the human body, when in a state of health, is about 98° Faht., a temperature which
cannot be much augmented or diminished without producing injurious results in the
system; but as it is impossible always to maintain so low temperature about us, Nature
has provided, by means of perspiration, a safety valve, by which the human body is
protected from the evil consequences which would arise from its exposure to a high
temperature—the principle on which she acts being as follows:—It is a physical law
that whenever evaporation takes place a considerable amount of latent heat, (<i>i.e.</i> heat not sensible to the thermometer), is absorbed, by which abstraction of heat
the temperature of the body from which the evaporation proceeds is greatly lowered;
but as evaporation consists in the absorption of vapour by the surrounding air, it
is evident that no evaporation can take place where that air is already <i>saturated</i> with moisture, and it is also evident that the amount of evaporation will depend
on the dryness of that air. Accordingly, in the Turkish bath, the air being almost
dry, when perspiration takes place it is followed by a rapid evaporation which cools
the body, and prevents its temperature from rising above a healthful limit; whereas,
in the vapour-bath and vapour-box, the air being saturated, with moisture, evaporation
cannot take place, and consequently as no means for reducing the high temperature
of the body exist, the heat is thrown in upon the system, raising the pulse, producing
feverish headache, and other symptoms of a highly deranged circulation; whilst a further
derangement arises from an insufficient supply of air to the surface of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb41">[<a href="#pb41">41</a>]</span>body. In the Turkish bath, again, the system, feeling that it has an ample supply
of air, is not called upon to quicken the circulation through the lungs in order to
obtain an increased supply, and thus another source of feverish excitement is obviated.
These and other considerations give the Turkish bath the pre-eminence, <i lang="la">longo intevallo</i>, over all other <i>artificial</i> modes<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1214src" href="#xd32e1214">3</a> yet invented for acting on the skin by perspiration.
</p>
<p>It may be observed that, <i lang="la">cæteris paribus</i>, the strength of each person’s constitution is directly proportional to the quantity
of oxygen which his system is <i>capable</i> of imbibing, for on this the vitality of his system and the purity of his blood,
and therefore his health, depends. Hence arises the importance of supplying the system
with an <i>abundance</i> of pure air, and the absolute necessity, when the lungs are by nature small and deficient,
of increasing that supply of air through the only other medium open to us, viz., the
skin<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1228src" href="#xd32e1228">4</a>—(the great supplementary organ to the lungs)—the necessity for improving and developing
the absorptive powers of which is in exact proportion to the lungs’ diminished capacity.
It is in this lies the great therapeutic value of the Turkish bath, viz., in its <i>opening the pores of the skin</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1234src" href="#xd32e1234">5</a>, and so improving that medium for the access of oxygen to the blood. Let two individuals,
one with large lungs, the other with small, pursue the same habits of living; the
individual with large lungs indulging himself to the furthest extent, consistent with
the continuance of his health, and it will be found, that his small-lunged companion,
in trying to keep pace with him, will utterly break down, his blood becoming diseased,
and his health failing him from want of a sufficient supply of oxygen to purify his
blood by burning off the carbonaceous matter which poisons it and depresses his <span class="pageNum" id="pb42">[<a href="#pb42">42</a>]</span>vitality. The individual with large lungs will indulge in alcoholic beverages with
<i>impunity</i>, to an extent which would entail consumption or some other miserable disease on his
narrow-chested companion; it was the great exercise, constant exposure to, and rapid
passage through, the air, (by which a large quantity of oxygen was supplied to the
system through the lungs) that enabled our fox-hunting ancestors of old to live a
life which their more sedentary descendants of the present day dare not attempt to
practise.
</p>
<p>Having premised thus far, we now proceed to a description of the principal features
of the Turkish, or more correctly speaking, the Roman bath: at the same time strongly
recommending to our readers the perusal of Mr. Urquhart’s pamphlet, for an historic
and detailed account of this interesting remnant of Roman civilization.
</p>
<p>The bath consists of three apartments, communicating with each other, each being dedicated
to a special purpose. The first, or cooling-chamber, consists of a good-sized room,
which may or may not be open to the heavens; but this condition is essential to it,
that it be well ventilated, with a free current of cool air passing through it. In
this room are placed sofas and reclining couches; and here the bather divests himself
of his clothes, and places his feet in wooden clogs, previous to his entering the
bath, the first act of which is enacted in the second or middle chamber.
</p>
<p>This middle chamber consists of a room fitted with marble slabs, and mattresses to
recline on; the ceiling being arched, and light transmitted from above through stars
of stained glass, spreading a tinted gloom through the apartment, which effectually
cuts off the mind from all communication with the outer world, disposing it to rest
or quiet meditation—a frame of mind peculiarly desirable for those who medicinally<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1246src" href="#xd32e1246">6</a> seek the bath. After reclining in the apartment for about half-an-hour <span class="pageNum" id="pb43">[<a href="#pb43">43</a>]</span>or three quarters, according to the temperature, which varies from 90° to 100° Faht.,
until the surface of the body becomes soft and moist, and the pores slightly excited,
you enter the third, or heated apartment, the Sudatorium<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1258src" href="#xd32e1258">7</a> of the Romans. Under a roof similar to the one already described, are arranged seats
of marble, together with a large platform of the same material, which is placed in
the centre of the apartment, whilst along the walls are ranged marble basins, supplied
by pipes with hot and cold water. In this chamber, the temperature of which varies
from 130° to 150° Faht., shampooing, an essential part of the bath, is performed,
a description of which process we will borrow from Mr. Urquhart’s interesting pamphlet.
Having placed the bather on the marble platform, he thus describes the process:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“The cloths are taken from your head and shoulders; one is spread for you to lie on,
the other is rolled for your head. You lie down on your back, the tellak (bath attendant)
kneels at your side, and bending over, gripes and presses your chest, arms, and legs,
passing from part to part like a bird shifting its place on a perch. He brings his
whole weight on you with a jerk; follows the line of muscle with anatomical thumb;
draws the open hand strongly over the surface, particularly round the shoulder, turning
you half up in so doing; stands with his feet on the thighs and on the chest, and
slips down the ribs; then up again three times, and, lastly, doubling your arms, one
after the other, on the chest, pushes with both hands down, beginning at the elbow,
and then putting an arm under the back and applying his chest to your crossed elbows,
rolls on you across till you crack.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>The foregoing account of the process of shampooing may appear anything but pleasant
to many of our readers; but they should recollect that it is a description of the
process when <span class="asc">FULLY</span> carried out, and that it may be modified to any extent, or wholly omitted, according
to the tastes of the bathers, or the physician’s prescription. Shampooing is, however,
healthful and invigorating, causing the blood to flow briskly through the minor veins
and capillaries, and bringing muscles and sinews into play which would otherwise remain
inactive, unless a large amount of exercise were taken; it also materially assists
in removing the inert skin from the surface of the body, and brings the pores into
healthy action. Few people, after once undergoing the operation, would consider <span class="pageNum" id="pb44">[<a href="#pb44">44</a>]</span>that they had received the full benefit of the bath were shampooing omitted. The shampooing
being concluded, the bather is conducted to one of the marble fountains already described,
where the waters are mixed to the required temperature. With these he is thoroughly
washed, the water being poured over the body from metal bowls. Soap is then had recourse
to, which, had it been used earlier in the process, would have materially interfered
with its success, as the alkali of the soap, by combining with the oily substance
of the epidermis, would have deprived it of the necessary consistency for its easy
detachment from the body.
</p>
<p>After a good lathering, and a good washing with warm water:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“You are led a step or two and seated, the shoulder-cloth is taken off, another put
on, the first over it; another is folded round the head; your feet are already in
the wooden pattens; you are wished health; you return the salute, rise, and are conducted
by both arms to the first or outer chamber, where the concluding act takes place.
The platform round the chamber is raised and divided by low balustrades into little
compartments, where the couches of repose are arranged, so that while having the uninterrupted
view all round, parties or families may be by themselves. This is the time and place
for meals. The bather, having reached this apartment, is conducted to the edge of
the platform, to which there is only one high step. You drop the wooden patten, and
on the matting a towel is spread, anticipating your footfall. You now recline on a
couch in the form of the letter W elongated, and, as you rest on it, the weight is
everywhere directly supported. Every tendon, every muscle is relaxed—the mattress
fitting, as it were, into the skeleton. There is total inaction, and the body appears
to be suspended.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>We shall not easily forget the sensations we ourselves experienced on first reclining
on such a couch, after emerging from the Turkish bath (as revived by Dr. Barter at
his far-famed hydropathic establishment near Blarney), enjoying a luxurious, balmy,
and quiet repose, followed by an elasticity of body and mind such as we had never
before felt.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1288src" href="#xd32e1288">8</a> We must here extract from a note in Mr. Urquhart’s pamphlet the following description
of the feelings induced by reclining, after the bath, on these delicious couches:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p lang="fr" class="first">“On trouve alors des lits delicieux; on s’y repose avec volupté, on y eprouve un calme
et un bîenetre difficile à exprimer. C’est une sorte de régénération dont le charme
est encore augmenté par des boissons restaurantes et surtout par un café exquis.”—<span class="sc">D’Ohsson</span>, t. vii., p. 63.</p>
</blockquote><p>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb45">[<a href="#pb45">45</a>]</span></p>
<p>Another writer thus describes it:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“When all is done, a soft and luxurious feeling spreads itself over your body; every
limb is light and free as air; the marble-like smoothness of the skin is delightful;
and, after all this pommelling, scrubbing, racking, parboiling, and perspiring, you
feel more enjoyment than you ever felt before.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>The object to be attained by the proceeding last described is to allow the body to
cool down after the perspiration produced by the bath, and to encourage the free absorption
of oxygen through the skin, the body being fully exposed to the action of the air
when the pores are in the best condition to inhale it. We would here observe, that
the Turks have given up the cold immersion of the Romans, which succeeded the last
washing with warm water in the third or inner chamber, after which the bather was
again conducted to the hot room for a few moments previous to his finally emerging
into the first or cooling chamber. For this immersion the Turks have substituted the
fanning of the body by a boy armed with a napkin or feather-fan, which, setting the
cool air in motion, rapidly cools the body; whilst, with the same view, Dr. Barter
uses, in some cases, the cold vertical and horizontal douches, or simple plunge bath,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1309src" href="#xd32e1309">9</a> according to the strength and powers of the individual, each mode realizing, however,
the same end—namely, the preventing the breaking out of a second perspiration.
</p>
<p>Mr. Urquhart thus finishes his description of the process:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“The body has come forth shining like alabaster, fragrant as the cistus, sleek as
satin, and soft as velvet. The touch of your own skin is electric. Buffon has a wonderful
description of Adam’s surprise and delight at his first touch of himself. It is the
description of the human sense when the body is brought back to its purity. The body
thus renewed, the spirit wanders abroad, and, reviewing its tenement, rejoices to
find it clean and tranquil. There is an intoxication, or dream, that lifts you out
of the flesh, and yet a sense of life and consciousness that spreads through every
member. Each breastful of air seems to pass, not to the heart but to the brain, and
to quench, not the pulsation of the one but the fancies of the other. That exaltation
which requires the slumber of the senses—that vividness of sense that drowns the visions
of the spirit—are simultaneously engaged in calm and unspeakable luxury; you condense
the pleasures of many scenes, and enjoy in an hour the existence of years. But this,
too, will pass. The visions fade, the speed of the blood thickens, the breath of the
pores is checked, the crispness of the skin returns, the fountains of <span class="pageNum" id="pb46">[<a href="#pb46">46</a>]</span>strength are opened—you seek again the world and its toils, and those who experience
these effects and vicissitudes for the first time exclaim, ‘I feel as if I could leap
over the moon.’ Paying your pence according to the tariff of your deserts, you walk
forth a king.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>Having now described the bath, as we hope, in a form intelligible to our readers,
we would make some observations on its physical and moral effects: and, first, as
to its physical. For cleansing the blood from all impurities there is nothing equal
to its effects. Sarsaparilla may hide its diminished head. By the principle of <span class="corr" id="xd32e1324" title="Source: endosmose">endosmosis</span> and <span class="corr" id="xd32e1327" title="Source: exosmose">exosmosis</span>, a principle well known to chemists, the serum containing all the morbid portions
of the blood, on passing off in perspiration, is replaced by water, and the fountains
of life are cleansed. This benefit will be appreciated when it is recollected how
many of “the ills that flesh is heir to” are derived from a diseased and morbid condition
of the blood. As an instance of the purifying effect of the Turkish bath we may mention,
that where mercury exists in the system, the gold ring of the bather has been turned
to the colour of silver, owing to the mercury amalgamating with it on its exuding
from the skin. Mr. Urquhart observes:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“Where the bath is the practice of the people there are no diseases of the skin. All
cases of inflammation, local and general are subdued. Gout, rheumatism, sciatica,
or stone, cannot exist where it is consecutively and sedulously employed as a curative
means. I am inclined to say the same thing in reference to the plague. I am certain
of it with reference to cholera. (In Cork the men employed in cleaning out the brewers’
vats, and who have thus been in a Turkish bath, were, during the prevalence of cholera,
free from that disorder. The other workmen in those establishments petitioned to be
put to that work.) As to consumption—that scourge of England—that pallid spectre,
which sits by every tenth domestic hearth, among the higher orders—it is not only
unknown where the bath is practised, but is curable by its means.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>We ourselves have seen obstinate cases of sciatica, which for several years had baffled
all the remedies of the most eminent Allopathic physicians, yield completely to the
benign influence of the Turkish bath in the course of six weeks. We have witnessed
similar effects produced in cases of rheumatism, and contracted joints arising from
rheumatic gout; whilst in cases of skin disease it is a sovereign remedy, unrivalled
by any other mode of treatment, not excepting the Harrowgate waters. And it should
be remembered, that all the beneficial effects here mentioned are experienced, not
at the cost of a weakened and debilitated constitution, too often the result of Allopathic
treatment, but in conjunction with an <span class="pageNum" id="pb47">[<a href="#pb47">47</a>]</span>improved state of health and body, the whole system being strengthened and invigorated,
whilst the special disease is driven out.
</p>
<p>We know that some people imagine that the Turkish bath is weakening in its effects,
but on this point hear Mr. Urquhart:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“We can test this in three ways. Its effects on those debilitated by disease, on those
exhausted by fatigue, and on those who are long exposed to it. First, in affection
of the lungs, and intermittent fever, the bath is invariably had recourse to against
the debilitating nightly perspirations. The temperature is kept low, not to increase
the action of the heart or its secretions. This danger avoided, its effect is to subdue,
by a healthy perspiration in a waking state, the unhealthy one in sleep. No one ever
heard of any injury from the bath. The moment a person is ailing he is hurried off
to it.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>The perspirations so often attendant on consumption, are nature’s last struggle to
supply the system with oxygen, by opening the pores of the skin, this additional source
of supply being rendered necessary by the diminished action of the lungs, consequent
on their diseased condition; the perspirations cease, however, on the patient having
recourse to the Turkish bath, as there nature’s efforts are superseded by an action,
similar in kind, but greater in degree, unattended by debilitating effects. As an
instance of nature’s efforts at self-relief, it may be stated, that in several cases
of chest disease, recovery has dated from the commencement of the nightly perspirations.
</p>
<p>The benefit of the bath in cases of consumption is undoubted,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1345src" href="#xd32e1345">10</a> arising, as we believe, from better oxidation of the blood, consequent on the improved
action of the pores of the skin, which enables the oxygen to enter and <span class="corr" id="xd32e1356" title="Source: ærate">aerate</span> it. As a result of this, the digestive organs are strengthened, and healthy blood
elaborated, the non-formation of which is the cause of the disease.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“Second, after long and severe fatigue—that fatigue such as we never know, successive
days and nights on horseback—the bath affords the most astonishing relief. Having
performed long journeys on horseback, even to the extent of ninety-four hours, without
taking rest, I know by experience its effects in the extremest cases.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>Again he says:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“Well can I recall the hâmam-doors which I have entered, scarcely <span class="pageNum" id="pb48">[<a href="#pb48">48</a>]</span>able to drag one limb after the other, and from which I have sprung into my saddle
again elastic as a sinew, and light as a feather.… You will see a hummal (porter),
a man living only on rice, go out of one of those baths, where he has been pouring
with that perspiration which we think must prostrate and weaken, and take up his load
of five hundred-weight, placing it unaided on his back.
</p>
<p>“Third, the shampooers spend eight hours daily in the steam. They undergo great labour
there, shampooing perhaps, a dozen persons, and are remarkably healthy.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1371src" href="#xd32e1371">11</a> They enter the bath at eight years of age. The duties of the younger portion are
light, and chiefly outside in the hall, to which the bathers return after their bath.
Still there they are from that tender age exposed to the steam and heat, so as to
have their strength broken if the bath were debilitating. The best shampooer under
whose hands I have ever been, was a man whose age was given me as ninety, and who,
from eight years of age, had been daily eight hours in the bath. I might adduce, in
like manner, the sugar-bakers in London, who, in a temperature not less than that
of the bath, undergo great fatigue, and are also remarkably healthy.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>We have seen at Blarney the Turkish bath administered with equal benefit to the child
of only a few months old, and the man of eighty summers.
</p>
<p>Having now observed on the physical effects of the Turkish bath, we shall quote Mr.
Urquhart’s opinions regarding its moral aspect:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“Next are temperance and sobriety. At first sight the <span class="corr" id="xd32e1381" title="Source: connexion">connection</span> will not appear so immediate. It will, however, be unquestionable to those familiar
with countries where the bath is in use. I know of no country, in ancient or modern
times, where habits of drunkenness have co-existed with the bath. Misery and cold
drive men to the gin-shop. If they had the bath, not the washing-tub, but the sociable
hâmam, to repair to, this, the great cause of drunkenness, would be removed; and if
this habit of cleanliness were general, restraints would be imposed on such habits
by the feelings of self-respect engendered. The poor of England have never had an
opportunity of knowing the comfort which is derived on a cold day from the warmth
imparted by such an atmosphere. How many of the wretched inhabitants of London go
to their chilly homes in the winter months, benumbed with cold, and with no means
of recovering their animal warmth but by resorting to spirits and a public-house fire!
The same six-pence which will only procure them a quartern of the stimulant, which
imparts but a momentary heat, would, if so expended, obtain for them at once warmth
and refreshment.
</p>
<p>“Do not run away with the idea that it is Islamism that prevents the use of spirituous
liquors—it is the bath. It satisfies the cravings which lead to those indulgences,
it fills the period of necessary relaxation, and it produces, with cleanliness, habits
of self-respect which are incompatible with intoxication. It keeps the families united,
which prevents the squandering of money for such excesses. In Greece and Rome, in
their worst times, there was neither ‘blue ruin’ nor ‘double stout.’ ”</p>
</blockquote><p>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb49">[<a href="#pb49">49</a>]</span></p>
<p>This opinion of Mr. Urquhart’s is further supported by the following extract from
Lord Stanley’s address to the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science,
as quoted by Dr. Haughton<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1390src" href="#xd32e1390">12</a>:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“All men know and deplore the destruction of life and property by intemperate habits
in England; but not all men know (though it has been repeatedly proved) that one of
the strongest predisposing causes to intemperance is that sense of depression, and
general weakness, demanding and seeming to justify the use of stimulants, which, itself
a disease, attacks those who live in undrained and unventilated localities.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>The Turkish bath supplies this stimulant, the desire for which prompts intoxication,
and so becomes, as Mr. Urquhart argues, a powerful engine in the promotion of temperance;
by improving the general health, it also removes the desire for the stimulus.
</p>
<p>Having now dwelt on the numerous advantages of the Turkish bath, its beneficial effects
in preserving health and curing disease, we cannot refrain from expressing our astonishment
that the year 1857 should find our noble city destitute of so valuable an institution.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1399src" href="#xd32e1399">13</a> Shall we any longer allow this state of things to continue, and permit barbarians
to enjoy a source of comfort and of health which we deny to ourselves? Shall we any
longer practise this self-denial, and any longer be content to lag behind the civilization
of the East? Is it not astonishing that our medical practitioners should have hitherto
overlooked the wonderful curative agency of this Turkish bath? and through its want
have permitted cholera, and other diseases<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1402src" href="#xd32e1402">14</a> equally fatal, to roam unchecked through our city, carrying off thousands of our
countrymen. Shall the sufferer from sciatica longer submit to the cupping, blistering,
and mercurial dosing of the Allopathic physician, undermining his constitution and
ruining his health, when he might obtain certain relief from the delightful and health-restoring
bath?
</p>
<p>We will not fatigue our readers by following Mr. Urquhart into his calculation regarding
the probable cost of erecting a <span class="pageNum" id="pb50">[<a href="#pb50">50</a>]</span>Turkish bath in this country, but we believe that an expenditure of about £800 would
prove sufficient for the purpose; and dull indeed must we be in perceiving our own
interests if we hesitate, for this trifling outlay, to secure to ourselves so great
a blessing—at once a luxurious indulgence, a purifier of the blood, a preservative
of health,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1409src" href="#xd32e1409">15</a> and a remedy against disease.
</p>
<p>It must not be supposed that we seek here to advocate the Turkish bath as a better
means of maintaining health than that of exercise to <i>perspiration</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1416src" href="#xd32e1416">16</a> the means ordained by nature for promoting a healthy activity of all the functions
of life: no—we can never improve on the laws of nature, which have been pre-eminently
adapted by a beneficent Providence, for the accomplishment of their specific ends:
it is only when those laws have been outraged and neglected by the “<i>over</i>-working-<i>brain</i> and <i>under</i>-working-<i>body</i>” habits of a 19th century, that art steps in, in the shape of the Turkish bath, and
proposes to produce those beneficial effects on the system, without injury to it,
which nature had <i>meant</i> to be produced by <i>active</i> exercise. The Turkish bath is, in short, an antidote for the unwholesome lives we
live,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1436src" href="#xd32e1436">17</a>—a peace-offering to outraged nature for our non-compliance with her laws. To ladies,
to invalids, and men of business, whose sedentary occupations preclude the possibility
of healthful exercise, the Turkish bath presents an inestimable boon.
</p>
<p>We strongly recommend the perusal of Dr. Barter’s lecture at Bradford to our readers,
as a masterly exposition of a subject by the only physician in the kingdom who has
<i>practically</i> studied it.
